Flask Foundation is a solid foundation for flask applications, built with best practices, that you can easily construct your website/webapp off of.

Built off of the [bootstrapy project](https://github.com/kirang89/bootstrapy)

Best practices were learned from
* [Creating Websites With Flask](http://maximebf.com/blog/2012/10/building-websites-in-python-with-flask/)
* [Getting Bigger With Flask](http://maximebf.com/blog/2012/11/getting-bigger-with-flask/)
* [Larger Applications With Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/packages/).
